# The software {.tabset}

This section outlines installation instructions for getting up to speed

## R
 * Download latest base R exe file from [cran.rstudio.com](http://cran.rstudio.com/)
 * Also download Rtools latest exe (if using Windows)
 * Install R then Rtools - if 64bit, install both 32 and 64 as it saves you hassle with other drivers

## Rstudio
 * Go to [rstudio.com](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
 * Select correct install file for your PC, and install
 
## Git
 * Download latest git version from [msysgit.github.io](https://msysgit.github.io/)
 * Install

## Configuration
 * Open Rstudio
 * Go to Tools > Global Options and set Rstudio to point at the location of your git.exe file
 * Restart Rstudio
     + If you don't automatically get the Git pane (top RHS) then Create a New Project and tick the source control checkbox
 * Open up command-prompt (or use the Git pane and select Shell in the extra options)
     + Run `git config --global user.name="Your name"`
     + Run `git config --global user.email="email@addre.ss"`
 * Go to the Packages area (bottom RHS) and select Install. Install devtools and installr
     + This can take a while due to dependencies
     + If you encounter any packages that could not download or install you won't be able to install Rtraining successfully, but typically re-performing ths install will pick up any packages a second time around
 
## RMSFTDP
 * Install RMSFTDP
     + This can take a while due to dependencies
```r
# Case-sensitive!
devtools::install_github("stephlocke/RMSFTDP")
```
 * Get the project from source control by going to New Project in Rstudio, selecting from version control, and pasting in the URL ```https://github.com/stephlocke/RMSFTDP.git```
